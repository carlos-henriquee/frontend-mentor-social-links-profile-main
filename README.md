## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to declare variables in CSS, this is really new for me:


```css
:root{
    --green:    hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --white:    hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --grey:     hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --darkgrey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --offblack: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Frontend Editor](https://www.fronteditor.dev/) - This helped me because i could test some code before passing it to the officially. I've already used this website and i intend to use more.
